# automating-metadata

A central place to drop all of our experiments!

The core of this project is to see how we can use LLM and other technology available to us to respond to the following problems (not an exhaustive list): 

1. Metadata is non-standard/incomparable. 
2. Metadata is inconsistently applied.
3. Metadata is inflexible

These features create a problem which makes relevant literature difficult to connect to eachother, leaves the decision of what metadata to include up to researchers or journals, and requries standard application to be useful. We then end up with inconsistent metadata that can't connect research projects either to their own research objects like the code and data associated with them, or to other papers that might be relevant. These issues make academic search and representing an accurate 'map' of science extremely difficult. 

We hope to see how we can create a flexible metadata standard that accurately connects papers both to their own additional materials and to other research based on as much data as we can gather. 

We're operationalizing this problem as: 

How might we reliably automate a literature review?
